To draw a cuore was not easy at all, finally I have had to use paper and pencil:

![Quadratic Cuore](project_images/cuore.jpg?raw=true "Quadratic Cuore")

But I manage to get something decent:

![Rafaela Alameda Step 3](project_images/step3.jpg?raw=true "Rafaela Alameda Step 3")

Let see if I can animate a bit this heart...

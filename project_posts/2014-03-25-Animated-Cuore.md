## Passing the chasm

I can draw a heart now what? I would be able to make it fly? I would be able to make it beat? 

Ok, next step, the heart fountain. I carefully review again the [code](http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=3150 "code") and realize that I just need to replace the dot with my cuore and it should work.

First I need to recover the code to draw the heart for the wirelib_0.3.js, I decided to put it there in order to use the same approach and keep code efficiency, but looks like I have to separate wires from shapes.

By the moment I will take a simply approach, that is add a new script with all the code I need inside, and refine it later on if necessary.

It works almost in the first attempt, and yes I need to tweak a bit to limit the number of flying hearts, but nothing important, I'm thrilled!

## The needle

Feeling invincible after make hearts fly, I try to simulate the needle. Now that I understand the basics is more or less straightforward to get the heart going up and down very quickly as I need it.

Now the main issues are solved, it is time to review the stylesheet and make the sewing machine looks better. 

Is this the last challenge?

## The last word was not said...

I was thinking about show my mother's name in the logo, maybe following the the big outside circle, but I struggle with the canvas text, how is it possible? I'm the king of the canvas!

Suddenly I came with a plan B. What about use google fonts, I can just add the reference and use the stylesheet to decorate the name. 

Ok, I loose the round effect, but who knows if I can do something similar with css. 

I decide to give it a try.

I found an example using Tangerine font and just apply it, not hundred per cent sure, but I definitely drop the idea of the rounded words.

Too many emotions in one day, I think I'm going to stop here.


## Wrapping up

The machine is ready to stitch cuores to the fabric, it is time for last changes and wrap up:

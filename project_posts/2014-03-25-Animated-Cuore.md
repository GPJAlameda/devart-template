## Passing the chasm

I can draw a heart now what? I would be able to make it fly? I would be able to make it beat? 

Ok, next step, the heart fountain. I carefully review again the [code](http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=3150 "code") and realize that I just need to replace the dot with my cuore and it should work.

First I need to recover the code to draw the heart for the wirelib_0.3.js, I decided to put it there in order to use the same approach and keep code efficiency, but looks like I have to separate wires from shapes.

By the moment I will take a simply approach, that is add a new script with all the code I need inside, and refine it later on if necessary.

It works almost in the first attempt, and yes I need to tweak a bit to limit the number of flying hearts, but nothing important, I'm thrilled!

## The needle

Feeling invincible after make hearts fly, I try to simulate the needle. Now that I understand the basics is more or less straightforward to get the heart going up and down very quickly as I need it.

Now the main issues are solved, it is time to review the stylesheet and make the sewing machine looks better. 

Is this the last challenge?

## The last word was not said...

I was thinking about show my mother's name in the logo, maybe following the the big outside circle, but I struggle with the canvas text, how is it possible? I'm the king of the canvas!



Once the machine is ready to stitch cuores to the fabric, it is time for last changes and wrap up:

Time to tell a story...

## Small Crisis

Two weeks gone and no progress with the project, the worst part is I didn't dedicate time to research and learn, so I've decided to change the project objective, same technology but different scope.

This time I've check if I can do what I've in my mind and the results looks promising. Small crisis solved!

## Changing the approach



This is the Logo I want to animate:

![Rafaela Alameda Logo](project_images/RafaelAlamedaLogo.jpg?raw=true "Rafaela Alameda")

and this is the result of start playing with the HTML5 Canvas:

[Animated Logo Draft](project_code/index_14.html "Animated Logo Draft")

I keep going, there is a lot of work to do!

## Small Crisis

Two weeks gone and no progress with the project, the worst part is I didn't dedicate time to research and learn, so I've decided to change the project objective, same technology but different scope.

This time I've check if I can do what I've in my mind and the results looks promising. Small crisis solved!

## Changing the approach to Agile

At the beginning one of the objectives was end up with a deep knowledge of how the canvas work, so I the approach was to visit the tutorials sequentially (the 31), practice what is explained there and take notes and ideas to apply to my project.

With just a week a few days to deliver, I've decided to change the approach to be a bit more agile. Instead, I'm going get into the lessons that I guess contains the knowledge that I need, and start to build de logo on the way.

As I said before this time I tested my ideas before start, so I feel more comfortable and motivated with the project.

## Starting with the objective in mind and taking my first steps

Ok, this is the Logo I want to animate:

The ideas I want to show with the logo are the following:

- Unique design with the same shapes on every design.
- Hand made thermal seeds bags with TONS of love on each stitch.
- A sewing machine that inspires.

This time I focus on build a web page draft, put the main pieces there, and play a bit with the wirelib_0.3.js. As soon I'm able to show the first animation, is more or less easy to place the rest. 

And this is the result of start playing with the HTML5 Canvas:

Ok, this is working, I'm happy! 

I keep going, there is a lot of work to do!

## CSS positioning

Last day I manage to understand how the animations works, and start take control of final result being shown. I have some tweaks in mind, but I'm going to put it on hold by the moment, because the next concern I want to address is how to position the animations in order to get the global composition.

after some css editing I manage to go from this:

![Rafaela Alameda Step 1](project_images/step1.jpg?raw=true "Rafaela Alameda Step 1")

to this:

![Rafaela Alameda Step 2](project_images/step2.jpg?raw=true "Rafaela Alameda Step 2")

I manage to draw and position the main pieces of the sewing machine.

Also a funny discovery, it is possible to overlap animations, this way you can see the cube rotating inside the circle, it looks very nice! 

I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it animation overlaping, because the shapes should be simplier, and could be too distracting. Well, I'm going to keep it by the moment, it looks cool.

One more day, I'm happy!

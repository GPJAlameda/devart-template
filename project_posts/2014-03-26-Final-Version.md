## The endless spiral

I could continue modifying the code endlessly, but there is a milestone to meet, and I'm satisfied with the result:

![Rafaela Alameda Step 5](project_images/step5.jpg?raw=true "Rafaela Alameda Step 5")

I realize that the font I've used is not the appropriate, it doesn't looks bad, but I think it doesn't match with the message. 

I dive into [Hack Design Lessons](https://hackdesign.org/ "Hack Design Lessons") and I found something interesting on [one of the lesson six blog post](http://sachagreif.com/more-google-webfonts-that-dont-suck/ "lesson six").

I try this new font [Cutive](http://sachagreif.com/more-google-webfonts-that-dont-suck/ "Cutive") and make some adjustments, I like it!

This is done now, and as I told before, it is time to tell a story...
